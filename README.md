**I DID NOT DESIGN THIS WEBSITE.**

As a fullstack software engineer, I'm interested in figuring out systems for traditional frontend coders to rival (or surpass) no-code tools like webflow and framer in speed.  The main benefit of this would be to allow for full customization while losing very little on speed for trivial tasks such as css & visual positioning.  The no-code tools are great but are always behind (afaik creating a scroll-based ThreeJS application on Framer/WF is a pain in the ass as of writing this).

The website was designed by [Brett](https://x.com/brettfromdj)! He's an awesome designer and I would definitely go give him some love.  I used his website in place of what a designer would usually give me so I could focus on the implementation side.

## Purpose
This is a **showcase repository** that focuses on allowing systems to arise naturally when implementing styled frontends from a design perspective, rather than "*clean code*".  The point was to focus on capturing design principles such as spacing, responsiveness, relationships into a Tailwind + CSS combination repo and explore how those can be sped up for development.

Consequently, the code in this repository is purposefully in one large blob, to allow me to experiment with new structures and have a baseline to evaluate its effectiveness for future projects.
