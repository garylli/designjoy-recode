# Disclaimer
I DID NOT DESIGN THIS WEBSITE.  As a fullstack software engineer, I'm interested in figuring out ways for traditional frontend coders to rival no-code tools like webflow and framer in speed.  The main benefit of this would be to allow for full customization while losing very little on speed for trivial tasks such as css & visual positioning.  Framer, for example, would not work well with full production applications.

This website was designed by [Brett](x.com/brettfromdj)! Go give him some love. An awesome designer.

# Showcase
This is a **showcase repository** that focuses on allowing systems to arise naturally when implementing styled frontends from a design perspective, rather than "*clean code*".  The point was to focus on capturing design principles such as spacing, responsiveness, relationships into a Tailwind + CSS combination repo and explore how those can be sped up for development.

Consequently, the code in this repository is purposefully in one large blob, to allow me to experiment with new structures and have a baseline to evaluate its effectiveness for future projects.
